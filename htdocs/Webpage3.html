        <h2 id="top">Who are the Junglers?</h2>
        <p>The Jungler is the player who roams the map, clearing out <a href="#camps">camps</a> in the <a href="jungle">jungle</a> and visitting laners for a gank if neecessary.</p>
        <p>the jungle, is one of the hardest jobs in the game because just like supports, they also provide vision and help laners get kills but they are also tasked to secure and take objectives as those can make or break a game.</p>
        <p>Junglers are, and will always be expected to take Smite (Smite is expained in the <a href="ExtraWebpage">Runes, Spells, Shopping, and Effects</a> page, but as of writing this, the page does not exist yet.) as one of the player's two summoner spells in game.</p>
        
        <article id="jungle">
            <h3>The Jungle</h3>
            <p>This is the part of the map that are not occupied by lanes and team bases. The jungle takes up most of the map.</p>
            <p>The Jungle is divided into two sides&#8212the blue side and the red side. Those two sides are also divided into two, creating four quadrants&#8212North, South, East, and Went quadrants.</p>
            <p>The jungle is comprised of camps, brushes, and plants which give way for awesome plays.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="camps">
            <h3>Jungle Camps</h3>
            <p>These are where <a href="#monsters">jungle monsters</a> reside. Junglers must travel from camp to camp to clear them out as jungle monsters are the Jungler's main source of <a href="CS"></a>Creep Score.</p>
            <p>The camps directly affect the map's geography as jungle camps have walls that separate them from other jungle monsters. The walls of jungle camps also block a player's <a href="Webpage1.html#Vision">vision</a>, hence the need for everyone, expecially Supports and Junglers, to provide vision for their team.</p>
            <p>There are 5 jungle camps on each side of the map. There are two camps along the river&#8212the Baron Pit, and the Dragon Pit</p>
        </article>

        

        <article id="monsters">
            <h3>Jungle monsters</h3>
            <p>Jungle monsters are creatures that live in the jungle, residing in jungle camps. Unlike minions, they don't fight for any of the two teams, making them neutral.</p>
            <p>Monsters only move from their respecive camps when damaged. When a jungle mosnter get damaged, their "Patience" gets triggered, which is what tells players how long a jungle monster is willing to fight. If this bar completely depletes, the monster goes back to its spawn point, rapidly regenareting its health. The monster can not be damaged nor engaged during this period. The monster's patience bar will not deplete as long as the monster recieves continues damage; however, there are exceptions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the monster walks too far from its spawn point</li>
                <li>If the monster gets damaged while there are no champions present</li>
                <li>If the target changes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each jungle monster is unique. Some deal tons of damage, while some don't deal damage at all. Here are the monsters of Summoner's Rift and the reason/s why they're unique:</p>

                    <td class="JGMonsters" id="dr">Elemental Dragons</td>
                    <td>The elemental dragon pit is one of the two contested objectives because of the effects and buffs that the dragons provide when slain. The first dragon can be either of the six Elemental Dragons. If the dragon is slain, another one replaces it 5 minutes later. After this dragon is slain, the third one has the power to alter the entire map, and will become the only dragon that will return to the map until someone claims its soul. The dragon Soul is the soul of fourth dragon a team has slain. Each dragon has unique effects that come with claiming their soul. Here are the ways dragons can alter the map as well as the buffs given by their souls:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Infernal Drake sears the Rift with her power, burning up some brushes and melting down some parts of the walls around the <a href="Red">Red Brambleback</a> and the <a href="Blue">Blu Sentinel</a> camps. Her soul adds an explosion to the team's damageing attacks and abilities upon impact.</li>
                            <li>The Ocean Drake floods the rift, allowing life to flourish (some of the existing brushes grow bigger, more brushes apear, more plants), and creating puddles of water in some jungle camps. The Ocean Dragon Soul allows the team who claimed it to heal faster, and regenerate resources like mana or energy faster.</li>
                            <li>The Mountain Drake causes mounds of earth to rise near <a href="#Blue">Blue</a>'s camp and <a href="Red">Red</a>'s camp, and on the entrance to the Dragon pit, creating more obstacles. Her soul fortifies the team who claims it, giving them a shield and making them tankier.</li>
                            <li>The Cloud Drake summons torrents of wind around Blue and Red's camp which gives movement speed to those who choose to walk in it, regardless of which team they're playing for. Her soul gives Ultimate Ability Haste, and movement speed to the team who claims it.</li>
                            <li>The Hextech Drake industrializes the map with hextech machinery, summoning end-to-end pairs of hex-gates within the two bases, near the Dragon pit, the Baron pit, which function as portals. Players are untargetable while riding the portals. Her soul acts like Infernal Drake's soul but instead of an explosion, the attacks and abilities casted by the team who claimed it also shoots a lightnigh bolt that ricochets to up to three targets near the first enemy struck.</li>
                            <li>The Chemtech Drake, Hextech Drake's sister, releases a toxic chemfog around the <a href="#wolves">wolves</a> camp and around <a href="#red">red</a>'s camp that hides anyone, regardless of which team they play for, in the fog. Her soul revives the team who claims it when they die, putting them in a zombie state for a few seconds. Sadly, Chemtech Drake was temporarily disabled due to the sheer amount of bugs that came with her (looks like someone forgot to get rid of their fleas).</li>
                        </ul>
                        After the Dragon Soul has been claimed, the Elder Dragon then graces the Rift with her presence. She is the strongest dragon there is. When slain, the team who killed her gets the title "Aspect of the Dragon", which allows them to execute enemies when the enemy's health bar drops to 20% of their maximum health by shooting them with Elder Immolation which is a laser infused with the Elder Dragon's raw power.

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="JGMonsters" id="rh">Rift Herald</td>
                    <td>Shelly resides in the Baron Pit is one of the crowd favourites. She will dance along with anyone who dances near her. When slain, she leaves behind the Eye of the Herald (that's her eye), which can be picked up (it goes to item slot 4 where wards are supposed to be). when the eye is crushed, shelly gets summoned and goes to the nearest lane relative to where her eye was crushed, pushing the lane. She destroys turrets until health completely drops to 0, or when she gets killed again. If the team wins while she's still alive, she does a vicotry dance. Lastly, she's actually a void-corrupted scuttle crab and is the only jungle monster who's sharing a jungle camp.</td>

                    <td>After Shelly get's killed for the second time, or after 19 minutes into the game, the Baron Nashor slithers into the Rift with a terrifying and defeaning shriek. The Baron is so large that it doesn't need to chase the player who attakcs it. it just needs to turn on an axis. The baron is also the only one who does more damage to player behind it than to players in front of it.</td>
