        <h2 id="top">Who are the supports?</h2>
        <p>In a drafted team, the Support is one of the two people who are assigned to the bottom lane alongside the ADC aka the Bottom-Laner. This role's initial goal is to assist, enhance, heal, and shield allies when fighting enemies. </p>
        <p>In a duo lane, the optimal strategy is to designate one champion to farm (farming is discussed in the <a href="Webpage2.html">ADC<!--This link will not work because the page where this link is supposed to lead you to doesn't exist yet. Please ignore.--></a> page) while the other is recommended to purchase an <a href="#Economy">economy item</a>. Supports are usually expected to do the latter.</p>
        <p>Supports are also expected to be the No. 1 contributor to the team's <a href="#Vision">vision</a> across the entire map.</p>


        <h3 id="Economy">Gold Income Items</h3>
        <p>Economy, aka Gold Income Items, are items that generate gold when you accomplish the tasks that come with the item. You can only have one at a time.</p>
        <p>All the economic items so far are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Spellthief's Edge which transforms into Frostfang which also transforms into Shard of True Ice</li>
        <li>Spectral Sickle which transforms into Harrowing Crescent which also transforms into Black Mist Scythe</li>
        <li>Relic Shield which transforms into Targon's Buckler which also transforms into Bulwark of the Mountain; and</li>
        <li>Steel Shoulderguards which transforms into Runesteel Spaulders which also transform into Pauldrons of Whiterock</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Vision">Vision</h3>
        <p>Sight, or more commonly known as vision, is a property of some units, structures, certain summoner spells, items, and abilities that represent a team being having vision over an area. However, the area which a team has no vision in is called the Fog of War which is represented visually as some sort of smoke or "fog" over the terrain, hence the name.</p>
        <p>Having vision is necessary to gather information about a non-allied unit. Such informations include, among other things, the enemy's current location, the direction which the enemy is taking, and their current health. Someone can provide vision for their team by laying down wards, utilizing oracle lens, popping Scryer's Bloom, Face-checking, and by using abilities that provide vision like Fiddlesticks' Passive Ability (Effigy).</p>
        <p>Yes, providing sight for your team is important for you to win, but denying vision is just as important. You deny vision to the enemy by placing control wards, revealing and destroying wards placed by enemies, and by using spells that near-sight enemies like Nocturne's R (Paranoia).</p>
        <p>Here are some more information about the things that can give and/or deny vision:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Wards grand vision over the surrounding 900 units when placed.</li>
        <li>Oracle Lens sweeps the surrounding area for hidden wards, traps, or enemy units. it also disables the wards that it found for a moment.</li>
        <li>Control Wards are like regular wards, but better. It provides vision like a regular ward, and it also denies the enemy vision by rendering the enemy wards around it useless.</li>
        <li>Scryer's Bloom is a plant that can be found in the map. Once destroyed, it gives vision in a cone going outwards from the plant. The direction it reveals depends on where you are are facing as you destroy the plant.</li>
        <li>Face-checking refers to physically going in a brush to see if someone's hiding inside</li>
        <li>If someone is near-sighted, their vision radius is decreased dramatically for a few seconds.</li>
        </ul>
