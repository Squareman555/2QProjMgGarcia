        <h2 id="top">Who are the ADC?</h2>
        <p>The ADC refers to the person whose job is to deal strong continuous damage with their basic attacks and scales with attack related stats - i.e. <a href="#AP">Ability Power</a>, <a href="#AD">Attack Damage</a>, <a href="#Crit">Critical Strike</a>, and <a href="#AS">Attack Speed</a>.</p>
        <p>In a duo lane, the optimal strategy is to designate one champion to farm, while the other is recommended to purchase an <a href="#Economy">economy item</a> (Economy items are discussed in the <a href="Webpage1.html">Supports</a> page). The ADC player is the one who's supposed to do the former.</p>
        <p>ADC stands for Attack Damage Carry as their job later on in the game is to carry the team by spewing out tons of damage using their basic attacks and/or spells.</p>

        <article id="AP">
            <h3>Ability Power</h3>
            <p> Ability power (AP) is a stat that boosts the effects of some items, abilities, and runes. Those effects receive a bonus proportional to the ability power of the champion. For example, if a champion has 50 ability power and one of their spells deals 100 (+20% AP)</span> damage, the damage of the spell is 110. The spell descriptions in the game do not show that percentage, they show the resulting bonus. The description of the spell in this example would show the damage of the spell as 100 (+10).</p>
            <p>Many abilities, items, and runes benefit from ability power through their AP ratios. Note that ability power does not always apply to magic damage; ratios can be assigned to any damage type.</p>
            <p>Items that give AP are: Rabadon's Deathcap, Lich Bane, Luden's Tempest, among others.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="AD">
            <h3>Attack Damage</h3>
            <p>Attack damage (AD) is the stat that determines the amount of physical damage dealt by basic attacks. AD also determines the damage of various champion abilities, items and runes.</p>
            <p>Total attack damage is comprised of base attack damage and bonus attack damage.</p>
            <p>The base attack damage is innate to the champion. It does not depend on items or runes and increases with each champion level.</p>
            <p>Bonus attack damage can be gained from items, abilities and runes. Increasing the bonus AD is the typical way to scale up the damage output of an AD-based champion.</p>
            <p>Items that give AD are: Immortal Shieldbow, Blade of the Ruined King, Stormrazor, among others.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="Crit">
            <h3>Critical Strike</h3>
            <p>A critical strike is a damage effect that deals 175% of its normal damage by default, denoted as critical strike damage. This can occur on some items and abilities, and almost always on basic attacks. Depending on the effect, a critical strike would occur under specific conditions, or based on critical strike chance.</p>
            <p>The most common form of critical strike occurs on basic attacks, which cannot critically strike structures.</p>
            <p>Critical strike chance is a statistic that denotes the probability that a basic attack will critically strike, as well as some other effects that use critical strike chance.</p>
            <p>Champions can increase their chances to critically strike and the damage they deal with critical strikes using items and abilities. Critical strikes are especially valuable for champions who deal damage primarily with basic attacks rather than abilities. Some champions, likes Ashe, have an affinity for critical strikes and benefit more than others from items that improve them.</p>
            <p>Items that give Crit Chance are: Kraken Slayer, Guinsoo's Rageblade, Infinity Edge, Navori Quickblades, among others.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="AS">
            <h3>Attack Speed</h3>
            <p>Attack speed (AS) is a stat that is the frequency of a unit's basic attacks. They are measured and displayed as attacks per second.</p>
            <p>Each champion starts with a certain attack speed ratio, which is also the value given by default to their base attack speed (attack speed at level 1 without any other bonuses). Some champions can start with a base attack speed different from their attack speed ratio. Additional bonus attack speed can be obtained through level-up or with a variety of items, abilities and runes.</p>
            <p>Attack speed is capped at 2.5 attacks per second (or 1 attack every 0.4 seconds). It also cannot be reduced below a floor of 0.2 (or 1 attack every 5 seconds). The values of these restrictions can be altered by certain effects.</p>
            <p>Items that give Attack Speed are: Trinity Force, Runaan's Hurricane, Nashor's tooth, among others. </p>
