        <h2 id="top">Who are the ADC?</h2>
        <p>The ADC refers to the person whose job is to deal strong continuous damage with their basic attacks and scales with attack related stats - i.e. <a href="#AP">Ability Power</a>, <a href="#AD">Attack Damage</a>, <a href="#Crit">Critical Strike</a>, and <a href="#AS">Attack Speed</a>.</p>
        <p>In a duo lane, the optimal strategy is to designate one champion to <a href="#farming">farm</a>, while the other is recommended to purchase an <a href="#Economy">economy item</a> (Economy items are discussed in the <a href="Webpage1.html">Supports</a> page). The ADC player is the one who's supposed to do the former.</p>
        <p>ADC stands for Attack Damage Carry as their job later on in the game is to <a href="#carry">carry</a> the team by spewing out <a href="#dps">tons of damage</a> using their basic attacks and/or spells.</p>

        <article id="farming">
            <h3>Farming</h3>
            <p>The act of clearing out minion waves and jungle monsters for gold and Experience Points is called Farming.</p>
            <p>During laning phase (the phase near the beginning of the game where everyone goes to their respective lanes until the timer hits somewhere around the 16-minute mark or when people start reaching level 6), the main source of gold and XP are minions. During this period, the players of both sides must have a creep score higher than their opponent.</p>
            <p>Creep Score, aka CS, is measured by how many minions a player has killed. The bigger the CS, the more gold a player has. The gold they earn will be used to buy items in the <a href="#">shop</a>.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="dps">
            <h3>Damage per second</h3>
            <p>Damage per second is the measure of how much damage a player can inflict in a second.</p>
            <p>A champion's DPS can be increased by doing the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Selecting teh right runes</li>
                <li>Building the correct items for that specific champion</li>
                <li>Doing the right combo to maximize spell effects and passives</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <article id="carry">
            <h3>Carry Potential</h3>
            <p>This refers to the player's potential to carry the team later in the game, where everyone is starting to level up, get better items, get fed, and get stronger.</p>
            <p>One of the most important skills that ADCs (or anyone for that matter) should master is kiting. Even if an enemy has so much more health and damage than you, you can still outplay them by doing this. To kite, you do a basic attack, then move to a different spot. Keep repeating that. Here is an example of <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxUXj7tfAPS_QFMrkHneigB9YlgOdVznaH">kiting</a>. See how Kalista took out the entire enemy team?</p>
            <p>Being able to kite can definitely bump up someone's carrying pottential. I mean, how would you be able to carry your team to victory if you're just standing there shooting away?</p>
